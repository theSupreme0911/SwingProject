## Painting module
Module consists of main window, which generates primitive shaped elements (ellipses, rectangles, triangles, etc.) with different colors, locations and dimensions.

At constant intervals, there is a new element added (drawn), which values are pseudorandom. The element has to have a proper location and dimension, so it fits in the window.

Resizing a window is followed by rescaling all drawn elements.

Program has to save information about generated shapes to a file
